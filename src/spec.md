# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a clearly labeled “Buy” entry point in main navigation so users can easily access the shopping experience at `/products` on both desktop and mobile, regardless of sign-in state.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a “Buy” navigation item in the desktop header that routes to `/products`.
- Add a visible “Buy” entry point in the mobile navigation (e.g., left menu and/or quick-links row) that routes to `/products`.
- Ensure the “Buy” entry is shown for both authenticated and unauthenticated users, with all user-facing text in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can always find and tap/click “Buy” in the site navigation (desktop and mobile) to go directly to `/products` to browse/shop.
